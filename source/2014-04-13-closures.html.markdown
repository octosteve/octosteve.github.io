I've been trying to gain an appreciation for JavaScript recently. Behind its
semicolon ridden lines, and funky funky functions, I've found it has a bunch of
cool stuff going on. I owe my appreciation for it to [Speaking
JavaScript](http://speakingjs.com/) by Dr. Axel Rauschmayer. Great book. Go get
it.

## JavaScript and Me
Up until recently, my JavaScript know-how didn't extend far beyond using jQuery
to select some element, and apply some class. Now with an upcoming JavaScript
module at [The Flatiron School
Fellowship](http://flatironschool.com/nycworkforce1/) I had to get on it.
Nothing motivates more than having to teach something to a group of students. 

I did what you would normally do when picking up a new language. 

* Learn about the language's objects and their methods
* Learn about how to create and manage scope
* Look for weird quirks
* Be completely baffled by closures!?

## Surprise confusion!
I know ruby has closures through lambdas... I just had no idea what that
meant. I just knew it was true! 

In JavaScript, you can't hide from closures though. If you're confronted with a
piece of code like this, you'll need to understand closures:

``` javascript
var step_by = function(step){                                                       
  var total = 0;                                                                   
  return function(){                                                               
    return total += step                                                           
  }                                                                                
};                                                                                 

var step_by_7 = step_by(7); 
console.log(step_by_7()); // 7
console.log(step_by_7()); // 14
```

### What is a closure?

Armed with this, I wanted to learn it on my own turf. Enter ruby.

## Closures in ruby

Any one that knows me will tell you I'm... fond of ruby. OK, I love ruby. OK, I
think ruby is one of the greatest things humanity has produced. Suck it
pyramids.

Knowing ruby had closures and having a definition of what a closure was, I
started devising some experiments.

### Context of execution

A closure's context of execution will always be the one it was created in. A
few experiments.

### Experiment 1
``` ruby
x = 5
my_lambda = -> { x += 5 }
my_lambda.call #=> 10
my_lambda.call #=> 15
```

Cool. lambdas can call things around them. Setting the variable `x` and the
lambda in the same scope allows you to call `x` from inside the lambda without
passing it in. Let's try something else.

### Experiment 2
``` ruby
x = 5
my_lambda = -> { x += 5 }

def my_method(closure)
  x = 371_292
  puts closure.call
end

my_method(my_lambda) #=> 10
my_method(my_lambda) #=> 15
```

WHOA! It totally ignored the `x` defined in the method! Now I started
connecting dots. That's why stuff like `instance_eval` exists. If we want to
change the context of execution for the block to be the method's, we'll need to
use `instance_eval` and pass it the block.

``` ruby
x = 5
my_lambda = ->(obj) { obj.x += 5 }

class MyClass
  attr_accessor :x
  def initialize
    @x = 371_292
  end

  def my_method(closure)
    instance_eval(&closure)
  end
end

my_class = MyClass.new
my_class.my_method(my_lambda) #=> 371297
my_class.my_method(my_lambda) #=> 371302
```

`instance_eval` yields `self` to the lambda. Since `x += 5` is short hand for 
`x = x + 5` we needed an accessor.

## Back to JavaScript

Armed with this knowledge, closures seemed to be a neat little feature that
didn't really bloom in ruby, but found a home in JavaScript.

The code from earlier is crystal clear now.

``` javascript
var step_by = function(step){                                                       
  // setup empty total value. This gets reset everytime you call the step_by
  // function
  var total = 0;                                                                   
  // this function is returned and because functions are closures, it will
  // continue to have access to both total and step!
  return function(){                                                               
    return total += step                                                           
  }                                                                                
};                                                                                 

var step_by_7 = step_by(7); 
console.log(step_by_7()); // 7
console.log(step_by_7()); // 14

var step_by_5 = step_by(5); 
console.log(step_by_5()); // 5
console.log(step_by_5()); // 10
```

Each returned function has its own copy of `total` so you could do something
like this and they won't interfere with each other:

``` javascript
var step_by_7 = step_by(7); 
var step_by_5 = step_by(5); 
console.log(step_by_7()); // 7
console.log(step_by_5()); // 5
console.log(step_by_7()); // 14
console.log(step_by_5()); // 10
```

## For the curious
Here's the same code in ruby

``` ruby
step_by = ->(step) do                                                           
  total = 0                                                                     
  -> { total += step }                                                          
end                                                                             
                                                                                
step_by_7 = step_by.call(7)                                                     
puts step_by_7.call #=> 7                                                       
puts step_by_7.call #=> 14                                                      
puts step_by_7.call #=> 21                                                      
                                                                                
step_by_5 = step_by.call(5)                                                     
puts step_by_5.call #=> 5                                                       
puts step_by_5.call #=> 10                                                      
puts step_by_5.call #=> 15 
```

Currying would work in this case too, but that's another blog post...

## Conclusion
While I'm still not in love with JavaScript, there are some really cool things
about it I'm excited to explore.

I hope this was helpful!

Happy Clacking
