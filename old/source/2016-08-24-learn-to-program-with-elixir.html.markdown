I've been helping people become programmers at [The Flatiron
School](https://flatironschool.com) for the last few years. I've taught hundreds
of people how to program using Ruby. I love Ruby. It's simple. Low ceremony and most
importantly, it gets out of your way and lets you code.

I love teaching with Ruby because it introduces abstract thought without
needing to know hieroglyphics. The skills you learn easily (code organization, 
programmatic thinking, debugging) transfers over to all other programming 
languages. My response to "What programming language should I learn?" from now
on will be "Elixir".

*But there aren't any joooooobs in Elixir*. You're RIGHT my fictional reader!
If you're interested in programming for the long haul, your first programming 
language should be to set you up for your career. I **could** suggest you go
learn JavaScript (I won't, I love you too much), but what if your first job is
building backends with F#? You trudged through JavaScript's idiosyncrasies
for what?! 

Instead, I'd suggest you learn a language that not only prepares you for the
code of today, but the code of the FUTURE!

One thing is for sure. The world is changing. For years, developers could wait
for the machines we ran our code on to get faster, and for a long time, it
did, but [The Free Ride Is
Over](http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm). With this in
mind, what if there was a language that was just as low ceremony as Ruby,
taught you the fundamentals of programming with that same level of ease, AND
laid the groundwork for you to to learn to build really powerful
applications? I think there is, with Elixir.
